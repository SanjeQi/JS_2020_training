    "description": "The Huawei MateBook X Pro is our pick for the best laptop money can buy in 2018. This is a gorgeously-designed laptop with a stunning screen (albeit with a rather odd aspect ratio), and it comes packed with cutting edge components that allows it to perform brilliantly, and a battery life that runs rings around many of its rivals. It also has a very competitive price, giving you features, design and performance for quite a bit less money."

    "description": "If you're after the latest and greatest laptop from Apple, we suggest you look into the 2018 model of the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The headline Touch Bar – a thin OLED display at the top of the keyboard which can be used for any number of things, whether that be auto-suggesting words as you type or offering Touch ID so you can log in with just your fingerprint – is of course included. It's certainly retained Apple's sense of style, but it comes at a cost. This is a pricey machine, so you may want to consider one of the Windows alternatives. But, if you're a steadfast Apple diehard, this is definitely the best laptop for you!"

Typically laptops of this size are these gigantic bulky things, packed with the most powerful components to attract creative professionals. However, while the LG Gram 17 abandons the full-fat H-series processors for Intel Ice Lake Ultrabook-class chips, it makes up for that by being a 17-inch laptop that's as light as a 13-inch one."
